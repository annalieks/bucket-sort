# Bucket sort
This is an implementation of bucket sort 
with functions for adding an element into the list in the array
 and printing sorted elements from all lists.                                          
#### How to use:
To build a program, firstly reload CMake project. Enter positive float numbers 
with values from 0 to 100 not inclusive that you want to sort. Enter 0 when the input is over. 
The program will show the list of sorted elements, from smaller to larger.
